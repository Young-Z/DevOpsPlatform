# DevOpsPlatform

This project is going to build up devops related automated utilities to help reducing non-value added development cost.

Project members trying to use our lesure time to be build up the project which means it expected to be slow progress and build from each small bricks to form the whole building.

So, here we are going to leverage TDD as our development method to deliver small validated functions and wire up them as components, modules and whole platform.
